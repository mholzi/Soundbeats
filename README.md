## How the Game Works

Soundbeats is a competitive music guessing game where teams compete to identify the release year of songs. Here's how it works:

1. **Teams Setup**: Up to 5 teams can participate, each with customizable names
2. **Song Playback**: Songs are played through your selected Home Assistant media player
3. **Round Tracking**: The system automatically tracks round numbers, starting from 0 and incrementing after each song evaluation
4. **Guessing Phase**: Teams have a configurable countdown timer (default 30 seconds) to guess the year
5. **Scoring System**: 
   - **20 points** for exact year matches
   - **10 points** for guesses within ¬±2 years
   - **5 points** for guesses within ¬±5 years
   - **0 points** for guesses more than 5 years off
6. **Auto-Evaluation**: Points are automatically calculated and awarded when the timer expires
7. **Team Rankings**: Teams are dynamically ranked based on their total points among active participants
   - **Round-Based Color Logic**: Team header colors change based on the current round:
     - **Round 0**: All teams display neutral gray gradient (no rankings shown initially)
     - **Round 1+**: Medal-based color assignment based on points
   - **Visual Ranking Indicators**: Each team displays a circular badge with their current position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
   - **Medal-Based Color Assignment**: Team headers change color based on points with tie support:
     - **Gold gradient** for teams with the highest points (all tied teams get gold)
     - **Silver gradient** for teams with the next highest points (ties for 2nd place)
     - **Bronze gradient** for teams with the third highest points (no skipping medal levels)
     - **Neutral gray gradient** for all other positions
   - **Real-Time Updates**: Rankings and colors update immediately as points change during gameplay
   - **No Manual Setup**: All ranking logic is automatically handled by the integration


## Highscore System

Soundbeats features a comprehensive highscore tracking system that automatically monitors and celebrates team achievements with **zero configuration required**.

### Automatic Highscore Tracking

The integration continuously tracks two types of records:

- **All-Time Absolute Highscore**: The highest total score ever achieved by any team across all games and rounds
- **Per-Round Highscores**: The highest score achieved during each specific round number (Round 1, Round 2, etc.)

### Visual Highscore Display

#### Dedicated Highscore Section
The Lovelace card includes a dedicated **"Highscores"** section that displays:

- **üèÜ All-Time Record**: Shows the absolute highest score with crown icon and golden styling
- **üìã Round Records**: Lists the highest score achieved for each round number played
- **Elegant Design**: Features golden gradient backgrounds and trophy-themed styling
- **Real-Time Updates**: Displays update immediately when new records are set

#### New Record Banner Notifications

When teams break highscore records, **celebratory banner notifications** automatically appear:

- **Prominent Display**: Golden animated banners slide in from the right side of the screen
- **Record-Specific Messages**: 
  - "New all-time record: X points! üèÜ" for absolute highscore
  - "New Round X record: Y points! üéØ" for round-specific records
- **Eye-Catching Animation**: Features glowing effects, crown animations, and pulsing borders
- **Auto-Dismiss**: Banners automatically disappear after 8 seconds or can be manually closed
- **Smart Detection**: Only triggers for genuine new records, not initial setup

### Highscore Persistence

- **Permanent Storage**: All highscore data persists across Home Assistant restarts and integration updates
- **RestoreEntity Integration**: Built on Home Assistant's reliable state restoration system
- **Zero Data Loss**: Records are safely maintained even during system maintenance

### Integration Features

- **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically compares current team scores against existing records after each round
- **Immediate Recognition**: New records are detected and celebrated within seconds of being achieved
- **Multi-Record Support**: Teams can break both absolute and round records in the same round
- **No False Positives**: Smart initialization prevents triggering notifications on first load

### Technical Details

The highscore system integrates seamlessly with the existing game flow:

1. **Round Evaluation**: After each countdown timer expires and points are awarded
2. **Record Checking**: The system compares new team scores against existing records
3. **Record Updates**: New records are immediately stored in the highscore sensor
4. **UI Notification**: Banner notifications trigger for any broken records
5. **Display Updates**: The highscore section refreshes to show new records

**Zero Setup Required**: The entire highscore system works automatically upon installation with no configuration, manual setup, or additional steps needed.

### Troubleshooting Highscore Display

#### Diagnostic Feature

When the highscore section displays "Highscore data not available", a **diagnostic information panel** becomes available to help troubleshoot the issue:

- **üìã Expandable Panel**: Click on "Diagnostic Information" to expand the troubleshooting details
- **üîç Entity Status**: Shows whether the `sensor.soundbeats_highscore` entity exists in Home Assistant
- **üìù Available Entities**: Lists all Soundbeats-related entities if the highscore sensor is missing
- **üí° Troubleshooting Steps**: Provides specific guidance for resolving common issues

**Common Solutions:**
1. **Integration Status**: Verify the Soundbeats integration is properly installed and running
2. **Entity Creation**: Check that the integration has successfully created the highscore sensor
3. **Home Assistant Restart**: Restart Home Assistant if the sensor was recently added
4. **Developer Tools**: Use Home Assistant's Developer Tools ‚Üí States to verify entity presence

**Usage:** The diagnostic panel only appears when needed and is designed to be unobtrusive, helping users quickly identify and resolve highscore display issues without affecting normal operation.


## Configuration

No manual configuration is required! The integration will be automatically available in your Home Assistant interface after installation.

**Zero-Setup Design**: All features including team rankings, visual styling, and interface behaviors work out-of-the-box with intelligent defaults. The UI automatically adapts to game state changes, hiding unnecessary sections when not relevant and optimizing readability without any user configuration needed.

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "Soundbeats"
4. Click to add the integration
5. Follow the setup wizard

The integration is now ready to use!

**Music Data Management:** Soundbeats automatically handles all song metadata including release years and playback URLs. You do not need to configure these properties in your media player entities - the integration manages this data internally through its custom sensor while utilizing your selected media player for audio playback and retrieving song titles, artists, and artwork. Media player selection is handled automatically through the integration's interface with no separate configuration required.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, the integration creates multiple sensor entities to track game state and provides a rich web interface for gameplay.

### Core Entities

The integration automatically creates the following entities:

- `sensor.soundbeats_game_status` - Main game status (ready/playing/stopped)
- `sensor.soundbeats_team_1` through `sensor.soundbeats_team_5` - Individual team information
- `sensor.soundbeats_countdown_timer` - Configurable timer duration  
- `sensor.soundbeats_countdown_current` - Live countdown value
- `sensor.soundbeats_round_counter` - Current round number (increments after each round evaluation)
- `sensor.soundbeats_game_mode` - Current game mode (default: Classic)
- `sensor.soundbeats_current_song` - Currently playing song information and selected media player
- `sensor.soundbeats_played_songs` - Tracks song IDs played since current game started
- `sensor.soundbeats_highscore` - Highscore tracking for absolute and per-round records

**Note:** The `sensor.soundbeats_current_song` automatically manages all music-related functionality including song metadata (`year` and `url` properties) and the selected media player entity. This sensor serves as the single source of truth for both the currently selected media player and any playing song information. The integration automatically coordinates between this custom sensor (for year, URL, and media player selection) and your selected media player (for title, artist, and artwork) to provide complete song information with zero manual configuration required.

### Lovelace Card

## Troubleshooting

### Card Not Appearing
- Ensure the integration is properly installed and Home Assistant has been restarted
- Clear your browser cache and refresh the page  
- Check that you're selecting **"Custom: Soundbeats Card"** when adding a new card
- Verify the integration appears in Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services

### Audio/Music Playback Issues

#### Next Song Function Not Playing Music
If the next song function triggers the timer but doesn't start playing music, check the **Debug Information** section at the bottom of the Soundbeats card:

- **Selected Audio Player**: The media player entity currently selected for playback
- **Current Song URL**: The URL from songs.json that was selected  
- **Media Content Type**: Whether the system detected it as a Spotify URL or regular music
- **Media Player Assignment**: Which media player entity is assigned to play the song

#### Common Audio Issues
- **Spotify URLs**: If you see Spotify URLs in the debug section, ensure your selected media player supports Spotify playback (e.g., a configured Spotify integration)
- **No Audio Player Selected**: The system now shows an alert notification banner when you click "Next Song" without selecting an audio player. Simply choose an audio player in the admin settings section to resolve this.
- **Media Player Compatibility**: Not all media players support all URL types - try different media players if one doesn't work
- **Network Connectivity**: Ensure your media player has internet access for streaming

#### Supported Media Players
The integration works with any Home Assistant media player, including:
- Spotify integration (`media_player.spotify_*`)
- Sonos speakers (`media_player.sonos_*`)
- Google Cast devices (`media_player.chromecast_*`)
- VLC media player (`media_player.vlc_*`)
- MPD/Mopidy players

### Game State Issues

#### Song Repeat System
- **All Songs Played Warning**: When all available songs have been played, a warning banner will slide in from the right
- **Dismissing the Warning**: Click the X button on the banner to close it temporarily
- **Resolving the Issue**: Start a new game to reset the played songs list and continue playing
- **Checking Song Status**: Use Developer Tools ‚Üí States to check `sensor.soundbeats_played_songs` for the list of played song IDs

#### Sensor Not Created
- Ensure the integration is properly installed and configured through Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
- Check Home Assistant logs (`Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Logs`) for any error messages
- Restart Home Assistant after installation
- Verify the integration loaded without errors in the logs

#### Teams Not Updating
- Check that team participation is enabled in the Team Management section
- Verify admin permissions if you can't see admin controls
- Try refreshing the browser page
- Check that the team sensor entities exist in Developer Tools ‚Üí States

#### Countdown Timer Issues  
- Ensure the countdown timer length is set to a valid value (5-300 seconds)
- Check that the timer isn't being stopped by another automation
- Verify the countdown current sensor is updating properly
- Look for JavaScript errors in browser developer console

### Betting UI Issues

#### BET Button Behavior Problems
If the BET button shows unexpected visual behavior on mobile or desktop:

**Mobile Devices:**
- **Issue**: Tapping the BET button triggers blue hover color instead of orange betting state
- **Solution**: The integration now uses CSS media queries to disable hover effects on touch devices
- **Expected Behavior**: 
  - Tap "Place Bet" ‚Üí Button immediately turns orange with "BETTING!" text and pulse animation
  - Tap "BETTING!" ‚Üí Button returns to blue "Place Bet" state
  - Orange state only appears when backend confirms betting is active

**Betting Info Display:**
- **Bonus points info** ("Win: 20pts | Lose: 0pts") should appear immediately below the button when betting is active
- **If not showing**: Refresh the page or check that the team sensor entity is updating correctly
- **Timing**: Info display is controlled by the backend `betting` property, not just button clicks

**State Synchronization:**
- Button visual state reflects the actual backend entity state (`team.betting` property)
- **Real-time Updates**: Bet button state is automatically synchronized with backend state changes without requiring page reload
- **No Setup Required**: Button state synchronization works out-of-the-box with the Lovelace Card integration
- If button appears stuck in wrong state, check Home Assistant logs for service call errors
- The betting state persists across page refreshes and accurately reflects the team's actual betting status

#### Troubleshooting Betting State
1. **Check entity state**: Go to Developer Tools ‚Üí States and verify `sensor.soundbeats_team_X` has correct `betting` attribute
2. **Service call verification**: Check Home Assistant logs for successful `soundbeats.update_team_betting` service calls
3. **Browser cache**: Clear browser cache if button behavior seems inconsistent
4. **CSS conflicts**: Disable browser extensions that might override CSS hover behavior

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Updates
- Reduce the number of teams participating if not needed
- Check Home Assistant system resources
- Ensure your device has sufficient processing power for the frontend

#### Memory Usage
- The integration stores team data persistently but uses minimal memory
- Clear browser cache if the frontend becomes sluggish
- Restart Home Assistant if sensors seem stuck
